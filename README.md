ðŸ“º KindelTV â€“ A Netflix-Style Streaming Mockup
KindelTV is a sleek and modern movie streaming mockup in a way or another, inspired by Netflix. This application allows users to browse and watch movies directly from Google Drive, utilizing Google's API for seamless video playback. All the details about the movies are stored within a database along with the link to the google drive video. I used Google Cloud platform since it's the only best option that I could find for free.
